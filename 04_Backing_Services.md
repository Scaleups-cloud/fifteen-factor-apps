# 4. Backing Services

Backing services such as databases, message queues, caching systems, and email services should be treated as attached resources. This means that the application should be able to switch between different services without changes in the codebase, ensuring loose coupling.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Loose Coupling with Service Interfaces

* **Interface-Based Programming:** In your application, define interfaces for service interactions. For instance, if your application uses a database, create a generic database interface. Implement this interface for different databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). This allows you to switch databases without altering the core application logic.
* **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to manage your service dependencies. This way, you can easily swap out implementations of a service without changing the dependent classes. 
<br> For example, in a Spring Boot application, you can autowire interfaces, and Spring manages the instantiation based on the context or configuration.

### 2. Ensure Consistent Access to Resources through URIs

* **Environment Variables for Resource URIs:** Store the URIs of backing services as environment variables. This allows you to change the service endpoint without modifying the code. For example, a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable could store the URI for your database service.
* **Centralized Configuration:** In microservices, use a centralized configuration service (like `Consul` or `etcd`) to manage URIs for different environments, ensuring that services can dynamically discover and connect to backing services.

### 3. Design for Portability Across Backing Services

* **Abstract Implementation Details:** When integrating a backing service, abstract the implementation details away from the application logic. For example, when integrating a message queue, your application code should not be tightly coupled with a specific message queue system (like `RabbitMQ` or `Kafka`). Instead, use a generic messaging interface, which can be implemented for any message queue system.
* **Containerization and Orchestration:** Use containerization (`Docker`) and orchestration tools (`Kubernetes`) to deploy your application. This setup allows you to define backing services as part of your deployment configuration (e.g., `Kubernetes services`), making it easy to switch or update backing services without changing the application containers.

By following these practices, your application becomes more resilient and adaptable to changes in backing services. It allows for greater flexibility in choosing, replacing, or upgrading services without significant rework in your application code.
