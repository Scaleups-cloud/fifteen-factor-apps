# 8. Concurrency

In the context of application design, concurrency involves scaling horizontally through the process model. This means that an application should support running multiple instances or processes concurrently to handle increased load or demand, rather than relying solely on increasing the resources (CPU, memory) of a single instance.

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Components to be Stateless and Scalable

* **Stateless Services:** Ensure that each component of your application does not maintain any internal state between requests. This design allows any request to be handled by any instance of the application, crucial for horizontal scaling. 
<br> For example, in a microservices architecture, each microservice should be stateless and independently scalable.

* **Scalable Database Access:** Design your database access to support horizontal scaling. This can include using `database pooling`, `read replicas` for read-heavy applications, or `sharding` for write-heavy applications.

### 2. Use Process Managers to Handle Process Scaling

* **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing and scaling containerized applications. It allows you to specify the desired number of instances (or `pods`) for your application, and it handles the scaling and load balancing automatically. 
<br> For example, you can use a Kubernetes Deployment to manage a scalable set of pods and a Service to distribute traffic across them.

* **Cloud Services Auto-Scaling:** Many cloud services (like `AWS Elastic Beanstalk`, `Azure App Service`, or `Google App Engine`) provide capabilities to automatically scale your application based on demand. You can define scaling rules based on metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, or request rate, and the service will automatically start or stop instances to meet the demand.

* **Process Managers in Traditional Deployments:** In non-containerized environments, use process managers like `PM2` for Node.js or `Gunicorn` for Python. These tools can start multiple instances of your application and distribute incoming requests across them. 
<br> For example, with `PM2`, you can easily start multiple instances of a Node.js application using pm2 start `app.js -i max`, which will launch as many instances as there are CPU cores.

By designing your application components to be stateless and scalable, and utilizing process managers or orchestration tools for automatic scaling, you can achieve effective horizontal scaling. This approach ensures that your application can handle increased load by adding more instances, thereby improving performance and reliability.
