# 11. Logs

In modern application development, logs should be treated as event streams. The application itself should not handle the storage or management of log files but should stream logs to `stdout` (standard output) or `stderr` (standard error). This approach facilitates the collection and analysis of logs by external systems.

## Best Practices

### 1. Stream Logs to stdout/stderr

* **Logging in Node.js:** Instead of writing logs to a file, a `Node.js` application can log events to the console using `console.log()` or `console`.error(). These logs are then naturally directed to stdout or stderr, respectively.

* **Logging in Spring Boot:** For Java applications using Spring Boot, configure the logging framework (like `Logback` or `Log4J2`) to send logs to the console rather than to files. This can typically be configured in the `logback-spring.xml` or `log4j2-spring.xml` file by setting the appropriate appender to Console.

### 2. Use Centralized Logging Services for Log Aggregation and Analysis

* **Using ELK Stack:** The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is a popular choice for centralized logging. Applications stream logs to stdout/stderr, and `Logstash` collects these logs, processes them, and feeds them into Elasticsearch for storage. Kibana can then be used for log analysis and visualization.

* **Cloud-based Logging Services:** In cloud environments, use services like `AWS CloudWatch`, `Azure Monitor`, or `Google Stackdriver`. These services can collect logs directly from stdout/stderr, especially when applications are run in containerized environments like Kubernetes or in serverless setups.

* **Log Management Tools:** Use log management tools like `Splunk`, `Datadog`, or `Graylog`. These tools provide agents or integrations that collect logs from your applications and offer powerful analysis and monitoring capabilities.

By streaming logs to stdout/stderr and using centralized logging services, you separate the concerns of log generation and log storage/analysis. This approach not only simplifies the application's logging mechanism but also provides more robust and scalable logging infrastructure, making it easier to monitor and analyze the behavior of distributed applications.
