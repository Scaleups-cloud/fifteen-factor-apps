# 9. Disposability

Disposability in application development emphasizes the ability of an application to be started or stopped quickly and reliably. This characteristic enhances the robustness of the application, allowing it to adapt rapidly to scaling, deployment, and unexpected failures.

## Best Practices

### 1. Ensure Quick Start-Up Times

* **Optimize Initialization Processes:** Minimize work done during the startup of your application. This might include lazy loading of components, optimizing code and dependencies, and deferring the initialization of non-critical services until after startup.

* **Containerization:** Using Docker or similar container technologies can significantly reduce startup times. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, allowing for quick and consistent starts. 
<br> For instance, a Docker container can be configured to start an application immediately after it is instantiated, ensuring rapid deployment.

### 2. Handle Shutdown Signals Gracefully, Ensuring Cleanup and Resource Release

* **Graceful Shutdown in Node.js:** Implement signal handling in your Node.js application to gracefully shutdown when receiving termination signals (like `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`). 
<br> Hereâ€™s a simple example:

``` javascript
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.info('SIGTERM signal received.');
  // perform cleanup
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Http server closed.');
    // further cleanup if necessary
  });
});
```

* **Database Connection Pooling:** Use database connection pooling and ensure that these connections are properly closed during application shutdown. This prevents resource leaks and ensures that the application can be restarted without issues related to lingering connections.

* **Job Processing Cleanup:** For applications that process jobs or messages (like a worker processing tasks from a queue), implement a system to either finish the current job quickly or safely pause and resume it. Ensure that jobs are not left in an inconsistent state during a shutdown.

By focusing on quick start-up times and graceful shutdown processes, applications become more robust and reliable. This disposability is crucial in modern cloud-native environments where applications are frequently started and stopped, whether for scaling, updates, or recovering from failures. Implementing these practices ensures minimal disruption and maintains the integrity and performance of the application.
