# 13. API First

The "API First" approach entails designing and defining an application's API upfront, before the implementation of its functionality. This factor emphasizes the importance of creating robust, well-documented, and easy-to-consume APIs, which serve as the primary interface for interaction with other services or clients.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use API Description Languages

* **Swagger (OpenAPI Specification):** Use Swagger to define your API specification. Swagger allows you to describe your API's endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods in a `YAML` or `JSON` file. This specification can then be used to generate interactive documentation, client SDKs, and even to mock the API for testing. Tools like Swagger UI can present this specification as interactive documentation that allows developers to explore and test the API.

* **RAML:** Similar to Swagger, `RAML` (`RESTful API Modeling Language`) provides a way to describe `RESTful APIs`. It offers features like reusable resource types, traits, and security schemes. RAML can also be used to generate documentation and client libraries.

### 2. Design APIs Before Implementation

* **API Mocking:** Once you have defined your API using Swagger or RAML, use tools like `Postman`, `Swagger Editor`, or `Mocky.io` to mock the API. This allows frontend developers to start building against the API before the backend implementation is complete.

* **Design Review:** Conduct a review of the API design with stakeholders (including frontend developers, backend developers, and potentially customers) before implementation begins. This ensures that the API meets the needs of its consumers and follows best practices.

### 3. Ensure Versioning and Backward Compatibility of APIs

* **Semantic Versioning for APIs:** Use a versioning strategy like Semantic Versioning (`SemVer`) for your API. This typically involves versioning your API in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/endpoint`) or in the request headers. This makes it clear to the consumers which version they are using.

* **Backward Compatibility:** When making changes to your API, ensure backward compatibility. This means that changes should not break existing clients. 
<br> For instance, adding new fields to JSON responses is usually safe, but removing or renaming existing fields can break clients. If breaking changes are necessary, they should be introduced in a new version of the API.

By adopting an API First approach, you ensure that your API is well-designed, documented, and ready for consumption by clients, whether they are internal (e.g., frontend applications) or external (e.g., third-party integrations). This approach leads to more robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs.
