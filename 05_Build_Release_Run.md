# 5. Build, Release, Run

The build, release, and run stages of application deployment should be strictly separated. This separation ensures consistency and reliability across different environments and deployments.

## Best Practices
### 1. Automate the Build Process

* **Automated Build Scripts:** Use build automation tools like `Gradle` for Java, or `webpack` for JavaScript. These tools should be configured to automate the process of compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application.
* **Build Automation in CI/CD:** Integrate build scripts into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. For instance, in a `Jenkins pipeline`, you can create a build job that automatically triggers whenever code is pushed to a repository, running the build script and ensuring that the build process is consistent.

### 2. Use Continuous Integration and Deployment Tools

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Tools like `Jenkins`, `Travis CI`, or `GitHub Actions` can be used to automate the testing and building of your application. Configure these tools to run your tests and build scripts each time a change is made to your codebase.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
 Extend the CI pipeline to automatically deploy the application to a staging or production environment. This can be achieved using tools like `Jenkins pipelines`, `Spinnaker`, or `GitLab CI/CD`, where deployment steps are defined and executed after a successful build and test process.

### 3. Ensure Reproducibility of Releases
* **Version Control for Release Artifacts:** Use version control or artifact repositories to store the output of your build process. 
<br> For example, store compiled binaries in an artifact repository like `JFrog Artifactory` or `Nexus Repository`. Each build artifact should be versioned to match the version of the code it was built from.

* **Immutable Release Artifacts:** Once a build artifact is created, it should be immutable. This means that any changes should result in a new artifact being built. This approach ensures that once an artifact has been tested and verified, it will remain unchanged and can be reliably deployed to any environment.
* **Configuration Management:** Separate configuration from the build artifact. Configuration should be applied at runtime, ensuring that the same artifact can be deployed across different environments. Tools like `Docker` and `Kubernetes` are beneficial here, as they allow you to define configuration separately from your application's binary.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your application's build, release, and run stages are efficient, reliable, and consistent, minimizing the chances of "it works on my machine" problems and making your deployment process more predictable and easier to manage.
